## K24: Day of REST
### Due: `2024-11-25m` before class

_Step 0: Form Dynamic Duo of Destiny with **other** shoulder buddy. Fetch KtS._

### Your Duo MISSION: 
Lay the groundwork for richer, higher-quality upcoming projects by casting a wide net for possible RESTful APIs to utilize, then filtering them to weed out the least interesting/useful and/or unreliable.

### Recipe for Success:
1. Familiarize yourself with the layout and SOP of our local API Knowledge Base.
1. Strap on your helmets and haz-mat suits.
1. With your protective gear equipped, and your skeptical goggles on, venture out into the Intertrash and find some interesting/useful RESTful APIs.
1. As you search (dedicate a browser tab to this), log any remotely interesting RESTful APIs via [this googdoe form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7z2fEMWctbIB4HXxw5Rbs5Ppr45UzVj1mowV_R7mVPxogEQ/viewform)
1. Document your findings. (Note anything notable as you go on your KtS. Adhere to SOP in the KB to publish to Devo fam the refined version.)

#### Specifications/Guidelines:
* Use Q&A forum liberally.
* __REST APIs only.__
  - In doubt? Find another API that is more clearly documented, and/or consult Devo fam via QAF.
  - On the provided lists of public APIs, look for the entries with "apikey" shown as their means of authentication. (Avoid OAuth, for instance. ***Do not submit to the googform any api that requires authentication beyond a simple apikey-passing*** -- Ã  la our NASA API.)
* Cards in our API KB are intended to be revised in an ongoing manner. Aim to have at least a stub, formatted properly. Get as far as you can in the time allotted.

<br>

##### DELIVERABLES:
* At least 1 API card per Devo in our local knowledge base.
